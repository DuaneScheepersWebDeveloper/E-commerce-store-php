# E-commerce-store
This is a PHP built application that is built primarily with PHP code, HTML,CSS and some Javascript.

 
## Description

In this application you will be able to shop and browse an online store that sells boxing gloves .

As a user, you are able to:

- [x] Add Gloves to your basket(cart).
- [x] Add and remove gloves from your wishlist
- [x] View Gloves of different brands.
- [x] Look at product information of a selected pair of gloves.
- [x] Increase and decrease the quantity of how many products you wish to order.

What I want to add in the future:
- [ ] Stricter validation all around
- [ ] Add a dedicated login system.
- [ ] Add a dashboard side of the application.
